# Ninja Showdown: An FPGA-Based VGA Game

A 2D pixel-art ninja adventure game built entirely in SystemVerilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA board. Players battle monsters and a shape-shifting final boss while navigating different maps rendered in VGA graphics.

## ðŸ¥· Game Overview

You are a lone ninja defending your village from monstrous enemies who distort reality. The game spans two key levels:

- **Level 1 â€“ The Dojo:** Face the elusive ghoul *Roko*, who shifts unpredictably and can haze your vision. Defeating Roko is optionalâ€”but satisfying.
- **Level 2 â€“ The Final Fight:** Enter the domain of *Radden*, the final boss who goes invisible, distorts colors, and fires deadly missiles from his spaceship. One hit from a missile and it's game over.

Power up. Navigate. Survive. Win.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **Character Control:** Move the ninja using on-board pushbuttons; platformer-style movement with gravity and jump logic.
- **Bullet System:** Fire shuriken-style bullets. Collision detection is implemented for ghoul and boss damage.
- **Boss AI:** Radden moves dynamically, changes color to distract, and becomes briefly invisible. Hit his core 3 times to win.
- **7-Segment Display:** Shows WIN/LOSE messages and boss health live.
- **Map ROMs:** Two separate `.mif` files store pixel-art map layouts for each level.
- **Pixel Rendering Engine:** VGA-compatible rendering with sprite and background compositing.
- **Modular SystemVerilog Design:** Code is cleanly modularized for clarity and scalability.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. **Hardware Required:**  
   - Terasic DE1-SoC FPGA Development Board  
   - VGA Monitor

2. **Tools:**  
   - Intel Quartus Prime (recommended: v20.1 or above)

3. **Steps:**  
   - Load all source files into a Quartus project.
   - Make sure `.mif` files are assigned correctly to ROM modules.
   - Synthesize and program onto the DE1-SoC.
   - Connect VGA output to a monitor and play using the pushbuttons.
